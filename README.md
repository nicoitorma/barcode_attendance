# DYNAMIC BARCODE-BASED SCHOOL EVENT ATTENDANCE SYSTEM

A Flutter project created for the course CS1131 Software Engineering

This software uses the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture. MVVM architecture is the easiest to maintain since its parts are compiled in a module style wherein the business logic is separated from UI elements, and the database itself.  

The "view" or the UI elements of this software are not aware where the data comes from. It only handles how the user interact with the software.

Architechture:
Models <=> ViewModel <=> Views
